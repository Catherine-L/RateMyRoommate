Rate Your Roommate README

Rate Your Roommate will be a website similar to Rate Your Professor, where users can write reviews about their past roommates so that users have a reference when they are searching for new roommates. Each user will have a profile page where they list their strengths and weaknesses as a roommate. They may also list what they are looking for in a roommate. Each profile page will also have a rating/star system based on predefined attributes, as well as a comments section where their past roommates can leave reviews on them.
